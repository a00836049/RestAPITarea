### Installation

First, install the dependencies:

```

### Running the Server

Start the server by running:

### Available Endpoints

Once the server is running, you will have access to the following:

- **Localhost** - The main server endpoint
- **API Endpoint** - A dedicated endpoint for API requests

Visit the Swagger API documentation at:

```
